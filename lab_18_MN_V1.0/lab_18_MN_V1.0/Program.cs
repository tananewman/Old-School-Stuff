//Pseudo Code
/*
1. Declare some constants and variables to store data
2. Creat a new instance object of the Random class
3. Prompt user as to whether or not they would like to roll dice
 a) Store this in char "response" variable
4. Create a while loop that will engage as long as the response is not 'n'. 
5. Inside this while loop, immediately create another that engages if the response is not 'y' or 'n'
 a) within this loop, tell user that input is invalid and have them enter a 'y' or 'n'
 b) Save input in response variable
6. Outside of this loop, but in the first while loop, create a loop that engages when response == 'y'
7. Call random methods and save them in the die variables
8. Create if/else structure to display if user rolls double 1's double 6's or something else
 a) Display results.  Display special message if they get 1's or 6's
9. Ask the user if they would like to roll again
10. Outside of all loops, display message for when user enters an 'n'.
11. Exit program
 
//Questions

1) For loop
2) For, do-while, or while, but break if die gets 7.
