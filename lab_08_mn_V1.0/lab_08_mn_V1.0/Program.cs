/*
1. Declare some variables and constants for later use
2. Prompt the user to enter the radius of one of the circles (they are all the same)
3. Store the value in variable named circleRadius
4. Calculate the area of the circle by squaring the radius and multiplying by Pi
5. Store this value in variable named circleArea
6. Calculate the area of square ABCD
 a) Add circleRadius to circleRadius 
 b) Store this value in variable squareWidth
 c) Store this value in variable squareLength
 d) Multiply squareWidth by squareLength to find the area of the square.
 e) Store this value in variable squareArea
8. Subract circleArea (since a quarter of circles A, B, C, and D are inside square ABCD, the sum of these areas is the equivelant to the full circle) from squareArea
9. Save value in variable shadedRegionArea
10. Print out shadedRegionArea
